        <h3>This is a website for all age groups. I have created this project considering the growing interest of individuals in online games. Tic-Tac-Toe is a game that has been played by everyone from childhood. Originally this game was created to play on pen and paper but with increasing knowledge and technologies all has been computarized. To jog the memory of those who have completetly forgotten the pleasure of playing this game, I have tried to my best to have an effect by creating this game.</h3>
